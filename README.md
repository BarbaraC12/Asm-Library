   <h2>Mandatory part</h2>
 </summary>  
  
- The library must be called libasm.a.
- You must submit a main that will test your functions and that will compile with
your library to show that itâ€™s functional.
- You must rewrite the following functions in asm:
  - ft_strlen (man 3 strlen)
  - ft_strcpy (man 3 strcpy)
  - ft_strcmp (man 3 strcmp)
  - ft_write (man 2 write)
  - ft_read (man 2 read)
  - ft_strdup (man 3 strdup, you can call to malloc)
- You must check for errors during syscalls and properly set them when needed
- Your code must set the variable errno properly.
- For that, you are allowed to call the `extern ___error` or `errno_location`.

   <h2>Bonus part</h2>

You can rewrite these functions in asm more details [here](Bonus.md). The linked list function will use the following
structure:  
`typedef struct s_list {  void *data; struct s_list *next;  } t_list;`  

- ft_atoi_base (like the one in the piscine)
- ft_list_push_front (like the one in the piscine)
- ft_list_size (like the one in the piscine)
- ft_list_sort (like the one in the piscine)
- ft_list_remove_if (like the one in the piscine)
